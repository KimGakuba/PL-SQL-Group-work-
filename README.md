# Hospital Management Package — PL/SQL Project

---

##  📌 What the Question Was About 

The task was to create a PL/SQL package for a simplified Hospital Management System.
The system should:
1. Store patients and doctors in database tables.
2. Allow bulk loading of multiple patients at once.
3. Allow displaying all patients using a function (REF CURSOR).
4. Allow admitting a patient individually.
5. Count how many patients are currently admitted.
6. Demonstrate bulk processing using FORALL, collections & records.

### This project is part of a PL/SQL assessment involving collections, records, procedures, functions, commits, and testing.

## *📌 2. How we Solved It*

✔ Step 1 — we created two tables:

patientss

doctorss

--- 

✔ Step 2 — we created the package specification:

This defines:

A record type for a patient

A table type (collection) for bulk processing

Procedures & functions required by the question

---

✔ Step 3 — we created the package body:
Implemented:

bulk_load_patients using FORALL

show_all_patients returning SYS_REFCURSOR

count_admitted returning a number

admit_patient updating admitted status

All operations use COMMIT for database consistency.

---

✔ Step 4 — we wrote test scripts:

Insert multiple patients at once

Display them

Admit selected patients

Verify admitted count

![count admitted](https://github.com/KimGakuba/PL-SQL-Group-work-/blob/main/screenshots/Q4/count%20admitted.png)


🚀 Final Outcome

Bulk patient insertion is working using collections + FORALL

Patient listing works using REF CURSOR

Admission update works correctly

Admitted count function returns accurate results

Test scripts run successfully in SQL Developer / Oracle Live SQL








# 🔐 Database Security Monitoring System  
### (Suspicious Login Detection Using Oracle Triggers)

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project implements an automatic **security monitoring system** inside an Oracle database.  
The system tracks all login attempts and automatically raises alerts when a user repeatedly enters incorrect login credentials.

This project was created as part of a PL/SQL and Database Security assessment.

---

## 📘 **Problem Statement**
The organization introduced a new security policy:

> “If any user attempts to log in more than two times with incorrect credentials during the same day, the system must immediately record the event and trigger a security alert.”

### To implement this, the database must:
1. Store all login attempts  
2. Detect suspicious repeated failures  
3. Insert a security alert automatically  
4. (Optional) Trigger an email notification  

---

## 🧩 **How the Problem Was Solved**

### ✔ Step 1 — Login Audit Table  
A table to record every login attempt (success or failure).  
Used for monitoring and counting failed logins.

### ✔ Step 2 — Security Alerts Table  
Stores alerts when a user fails login more than two times in a day.

---

### ✔ Step 3 — Compound Trigger (Mutating-safe)  
A normal row-level trigger caused:
```
ORA-04091: table is mutating
```
because it queried the same table during an insert.

**Solution:** A **compound trigger** that:  
- Collects all failed attempts in memory  
- After the statement completes, counts failures from the table  
- Inserts alerts only when needed  
- Avoids mutating-table errors
